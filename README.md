# Server Administration and Hosting Platform using Docker containerization

This is a project that I did with my group mates in CS307 - System Practicum course in IIT Mandi. The aim of the project is to develop an administration and hosting platform to support heterogeneous applications with load balancing. 

- **Objective** :
Imagine you are a hosting platform. People need to host their web-apps through your server. Now these web-apps can use different frameworks such as NodeJS, Ruby-on-Rails, Django, etc. and can have different type of database storages as well like MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc. Installing all these technologies will create a ruckus on the server, as it will make a clutter of information, and will require deep understanding of the system by the system administrators. To provide isolation and capability to host applications with heterogeneous technologies, we use Docker containerization technology.

- **Additional Features** :
Sometimes it may happen that one of your hosted web-app becomes popular enough that it starts getting million of requests per second. We have also developed a load balancing mechanism which solves the above problem.

Read more on the above in the documentation and report that I have provided.
